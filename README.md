# Maze Generator

This is a program that generates a maze using the recursive back tracker algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using a stack to circumvent the recursion limit

Once the maze is generated, either BFS or A* can be used to find the shortest path from start to end

The maze is illustrated using the tkinter library and is capable of displaying mazes with dimensions up to 150 x 150 blocks
